# Reddit-Fantasy-Football-Scraper

# Summary:

The code in this repository was written to scrape Reddit fantasy football posts and identify posts that reference a single active NFL player. Sentiment analysis is conducted on the posts to determine if it's a positive or negative thought about the player and then all of the post's associated comments are scraped as well. Sentiment analysis is then performed on the comments and averaged for each post to determine if users tend to agree or disagree with it.

The next steps will be to import this collected data into Google Looker Studios to create a dashboard that displays the top 5 crowdsourced fantasy draft picks at each position.

# Future Updates:

The next update to make will be sorting posts as neutral, positive, or negative and using that to inform the overall sentiment of the comments.
