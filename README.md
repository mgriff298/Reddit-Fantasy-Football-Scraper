# Reddit-Fantasy-Football-Scraper

# Summary:

The code in this repository was written to scrape Reddit fantasy football posts and identify posts that reference a single active NFL player. Sentiment analysis is conducted on the posts to determine if it's a positive or negative thought about the player and then all of the post's associated comments are scraped as well. Sentiment analysis is then performed on the comments and averaged for each post to determine if users tend to agree or disagree with it.

# Dashboard:

I have created a dashboard view of the collected and analyzed data using Google Looker Studios. The dashboard (linked below) displays the top 5 crowdsourced fantasy draft picks at each position, player opinion over time, and a full view of the data captured.

# Future Updates:

The next update to make will be sorting posts as neutral, positive, or negative and using that to inform the overall sentiment of the comments.
